Jet is a JavaScript Server running on Mozilla SpiderMonkey with XPCOM/XPConnect functionality.

Based on the XULRunner stack, it supports extensions as per ordinary XULRunner/Firefox apps.

Download and copy the XULRunner binaries into Jet/bin directory.
See: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/

To run execute Jet.bat


I'll get round to writing some more useful docs ASAP, however look at the Jester and Xulu extensions to get an idea of how to build them.
