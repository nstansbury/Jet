Jet is a JavaScript Server running on Mozilla SpiderMonkey with XPCOM/XPConnect functionality.

Based on the XULRunner stack, it supports extensions as per ordinary XULRunner/Firefox apps.

Download and copy the XULRunner binaries into Jet/bin directory.
See: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/

To run execute Jet.bat


I'll get round to writing some more useful docs ASAP, however look at the Jester and Xulu extensions to get an idea of
how to build them.

Mozilla build 16.0b2 works as expected, builds after that fail to raise DOM events in the nsIAppShellService hiddenWindow
